# Introduction to Machine Learning on Azure

This repository contains a three notebook series that helps you get started with Machine Learning on
Azure.

* The first notebook is an introduction to classic machine learning algorithms.
* The second notebook is an introduction to deep learning using PyTorch. We recommend that you sign
  into Azure Notebooks to take advantage of our Free GPU offer to accelerate training your model.
* The third notebook is an introduction to the Azure Machine Learning Service. Because it uses the
  Azure Machine Learning Service, you must be signed into Azure Notebooks to run the code in this
  notebook.
* The fourth notebook introduces advanced topics in the AML Service, such as running HyperDrive jobs
  for hyper-parameter tuning.
